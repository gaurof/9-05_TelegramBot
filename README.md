The phone rings.

Oh, no⁠—how long have you been asleep?  Sure, it was a tough night, but…  This is bad.  This is very bad.

# What is this project
This is a Telegram Bot where you can play the text game 9:05 in basically any language.
It uses Selenium to parse text from <a href="https://adamcadre.ac/if/905.html">the website</a>, sends a google translate request to translate it, then finally it sends that translated text to the user in telegram.
It also translates the user commands from any language into english, though that part doesn't work that well.
